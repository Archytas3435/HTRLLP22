        Chapter 22 of “How to Read Literature Like a Professor” is concerned
        with the use of blindness in literature. Given that sight is such an
        incredibly important sense, depriving a character of it has significant
        implications on their descriptions and interactions within the work. As
        such, it is important to recognize what questions readers need to ask
        about a piece of literature rather than determining precise answers.
        Generally, the motif of blindness is used to reveal hidden truths or
        convey innocence. Blindness also must follow the Indiana Jones
        Principle, which states that an important quality about a character
        needs to be introduced early on before it can affect the plot later in
        the text. In sum, blindness, both literal and metaphorical, can be used
        in various ways to reveal pervasive insights about a character’s
        ignorance, denial, or innocence.
